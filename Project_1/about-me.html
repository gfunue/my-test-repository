    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>
        Am very thrilled when learning new things. I am still on my way to acquiring my bachelor’s degree which I pride myself on because I love education. I will definitely go in for my master’s degree after completing my bachelor’s degree. I find knowledge which might not only be through formal education, the key to success because it expands your thinking skills and makes learning new things easier in general.

    <h4>Traveling</h4>
        <p>
        Am interested in traveling to new places to meet new people, learn and experience different cultures and get to know why and how people have different perspectives of the world. The only place I have traveled frequently is back and forth from my country of birth (Cameroon) and some states within the U.S. which all have their cultural differences. Looking forward to traveling around the world when I have the finance and opportunity.

    <h4>Nature</h4>
    <p>
        When am out there in the woods/park, it just feels different. Nature feels therapeutic, peaceful, and true to its core. Just the smell of the leaves relieves my stress. The natural noise from the wind, birds and animals is something I admire in nature. The sad news is that I don’t get to visit the forest because of coal during winter and time constraint.

    <h4>Animals</h4>
    <p>
        I grew up in a farm-like environment which has instilled in me the love for grazing. I love raising animals of my own of which I haven’t have that opportunity in the U.S. I plan on buying my house in a countryside so I can raise animals of my own. It draws me closer to nature.

    <h4>Family</h4>
    <p>
        Although I don’t have a family of my own yet, I’m a family like orientated person. I love my siblings and parents. We all might have our differences, but we never failed to be there for each other. Every single minute spent with my family is worth it. Since we are now far apart, we always call to check each other. Apart from my family, I love seeing people smiling together. It’s just enjoyable and creates a conducive environment.

    <h4>Cooking</h4>
    <p>
        I love food but very picky, so I have no other choice but to always cook my own food. Cooking is something I enjoy doing or maybe because am living alone? I don’t think so because my nickname when growing up was “chief cook” because I was always in the kitchen cooking something up. I was even cooking for my entire family in my early 15s. Hey, anything cooking, let me know.

    <h4>Listening to Music</h4>
    <p>
        If genie wants to grant me a wish today, I will definitely go for a musician specifically a country musician. I love music to the core but not talented in that domain. I always listen to country music because most of it reminds me of home and I can relate to most of it due to life experience. My favorite country musicians are Luke Combs and Alain Jackson.

<h4>Playing video games</h4>
    <p>
        Love playing video games on my down time as well especially when my friends come over. To be specific, the only video games I’m playing on my play station is soccer (football), Mortal Combat on my mobile phone and Need for Speed on my tablet. Love playing soccer the most because its challenging and it’s a game of my home country.
