            I was born on June 26, 1995, in Bamenda Cameroon. I went to primary and secondary school in Bamendankwe. I graduated from secondary school which is equivalent to one year college in the U.S by 2016. Searching for greener pasture, I migrated to the U.S through the American DV lottery by June 3rd, 2017. I spent most of my years in Baltimore Maryland.

            After my first two weeks in the U.S, I got my first full time job At Little sisters of the poor (St. Martins Home) in Catonsville Maryland. I worked there as a dining aid. My role was getting food from the kitchen and serving it to the elderly and cleaning up after breakfast and lunch. I worked there for one and a half years.

            While still working morning shift at Little sisters of the poor, I got my second full time job at ABM branch in Towson University. My role at ABM was cleaning the classrooms, computer labs, laboratory, toilets hallways and others. So basically, housekeeping. I worked night shift for ABM for about two years as well.

            After my one-year anniversary in the U.S, I decided to enroll into college majoring in Information Technology. Started college in 2018 at Community College of Baltimore County and graduated in 2021. I was still working my two full time jobs at this time which was challenging.

            By late 2018, I quit the job at Little sisters of the poor and got another job as Amazon warehouse associate at Sparrows Point Blvd Baltimore MD. After working as a picker for a few months, I got an award for the best picker in the building and was later trained to work on a live floor managing faulty robots to keep the work flowing.
